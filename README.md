# online-doc-link-checker
Contains checkers for online docs. This repository contains two Python files, one for web page checking and the other for markdown link checking. The report generation logic depends on the Windows file system. We assume that the web page documentation is sourced in markdown.
You can also alter the path to match Linux or MacOS file systems.
